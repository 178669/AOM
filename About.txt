This is a GUI specially designed for The Fashion Library's physical and portable second-hand clothing vending machine.
The Fashion Library is a Capstone Project made in the best class at the University of Pittsburgh (in my opinion): The Art of Making (AOM): An Introduction to Hands-On System Design and Engineering.

    Thank you Dr. Samosky for creating and improving AOM to the phenomenal student experience it is today.
    Thank you to the best team members I've ever had: Caeden Wargo, Lauren Gilfillan, Lauren Harrington, & Jason Worrell. ðŸ’— you all
